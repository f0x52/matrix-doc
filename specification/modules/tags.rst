Room Tagging
============

.. _module:tagging:

Users can add tags to rooms. Tags are short strings used to label rooms, e.g.
"work", "family". A room may have multiple tags. Tags are only visible to the
user that set them but are shared across all their devices.

Events
------

The tags on a room are received as single ``m.tag`` event in the
``account_data`` section of a room in a ``/sync``.

The ``m.tag`` can also be received in a ``/events`` response or in the
``account_data`` section of a room in ``/initialSync``. ``m.tag``
events appearing in ``/events`` will have a ``room_id`` with the room
the tags are for.

Each tag has an associated JSON object with information about the tag, e.g how
to order the rooms with a given tag.

Ordering information is given under the ``order`` key as a string. The string
are compared lexicographically by unicode codepoint to determine which should
displayed first. So a room with a tag with an ``order`` key of ``"apples"``
would appear before a room with a tag with an ``order`` key of ``"oranges"``.
If a room has a tag without an ``order`` key then it should appear after the
rooms with that tag that have an ``order`` key.

The name of a tag MUST not exceed 255 bytes.

The name of a tag should be human readable. When displaying tags for a room a
client should display this human readable name. When adding a tag for a room
a client may offer a list to choose from that includes all the tags that the
user has previously set on any of their rooms.

Two special names are listed in the specification:

* ``m.favourite``
* ``m.lowpriority``

{{m_tag_event}}

Tags namespaces are defined in the following way, depending on how the client are expected to interpret them:

* The namespace ``m.*`` is reserved for tags defined in the current specification
* The namespace ``u.*`` is reserved for user-defined tags, and the client should not try to interpret as anything other than an utf8 string
* A client or app willing to use special tags for advanced functionnality should namespace them similarly to state keys: ``tld.name.*``
* Any tag in the ``tld.name.*`` form but not matching the namespace of the current client should be ignored
* Any tag not matching the previous rules should be interpreted as an user tag from the ``u.*`` namespace
